Power BI - Capstone Project: Coffee Quality Analysis
üìå Project Overview
This Power BI Capstone Project explores coffee quality data provided by the Coffee Quality Institute (CQI), a non-profit organization dedicated to improving coffee standards globally. Using a rich dataset, we analyze key factors that influence coffee quality, including sensory attributes, processing methods, and defect occurrences.

üìä Dataset Information
The dataset contains various attributes related to coffee production, processing, and sensory evaluation, such as:

Sensory Evaluations: Aroma, flavor, aftertaste, acidity, body, balance, uniformity, clean cup, sweetness, and total cup points.
Defects Analysis: Category One (e.g., black beans, insect damage) and Category Two (e.g., over-fermentation, staleness).
Additional Attributes: Coffee origin, processing method, and genetic factors.

üéØ Key Objectives
Understanding Coffee Quality Factors: Identify the key sensory attributes influencing overall coffee quality.
Correlation Analysis: Explore the relationship between processing methods, coffee origin, and sensory scores.
Defect Impact: Analyze trends in defect occurrences and their effect on coffee ratings.
Predicting Total Cup Points: Assess how different variables contribute to overall coffee quality.
Customer Insights: Identify patterns in customer ratings based on time of day and day of the week.

üîç Insights & Findings
Through Power BI visualizations, this project uncovers significant trends in coffee quality and highlights the factors that contribute to premium coffee production. The interactive dashboards allow for a deeper exploration of coffee characteristics, enabling stakeholders to make data-driven decisions.
